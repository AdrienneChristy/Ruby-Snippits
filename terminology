Environment is the collection of all variables and their values that exist in the program at a given time.

Control flow gives us the flexibility to select different outcomes depending on information the user types, the result of a computation, or the value returned by another part of the program.

In Ruby, we assign values to variables using =, the assignment operator. But if we've already used = for assignment, how do we check to see if two things are equal? Well, we use ==, which is a comparator (also called a relational operator). == means "is equal to." 

Separation of concerns: assigning specific tasks to separate methods


Method Syntax

Methods are defined using the keyword def (short for "define"). Methods have three parts:

    The header, which includes the def keyword, the name of the method, and any arguments the method takes. (We'll get to arguments in the next section)
    The body, which is the code block that describes the procedures the method carries out. The body is indented two spaces by convention (as with for, if, elsif, and else statements)
    The method ends with the end keyword.
